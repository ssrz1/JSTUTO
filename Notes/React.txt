Component:
	It is a javaScript function that returns some amount of JSX.(means what content we want to show on screen.)
	Secondly we attempt to make components as reuseable as possible.So we can write one component and use it on several other locations.

FlexBox:
	It is a system of Positioning elements within the container.
	e.g we have containing elements of VIEW and the child element of the TEXT we can use Flexbox.
 	We can tell react native how we want to position the text tag within the overall view tag.
By default every thing in React Native will position itself in top left corner.
	We need to be aware of to get our TEXT to be centered in the middle of VIEW we need to keep 2 things in mind.
	
	1. justifyContent
		It is used to position elements in the VERTICAL DIRECTION.
		justifyContent: 'flex-start'
		justifyContent: 'center'
		justifyContent: 'flex-end'.
	it move from up to down only not changing it horizontillay
	2. aliginItem
		With alignItems we position items to the horizontal direction.
